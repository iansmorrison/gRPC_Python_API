# gRPC_Python_API
Experimental server and client code for a gRPC-based API for SETI and astronomy

Most recent directories are the most interesting:

	complex_signal_demo: working demo of retrieval of a complex-valued one-dimensional signal (which happens to be a complex-exponential) from server
	
	server_to_client_demo: in-progress demo of the retrieval of a complex-valued one- or two-dimensional signal from server with very flexible metadata infrastructure
